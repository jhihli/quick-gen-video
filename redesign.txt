Please redesign project, and update web title name with QWGenv, now has only one video generation page. Please help me plan the following changes:

1. Redesign to Two Pages: Split the existing project into two pages: Home and Generator(Make sure two page's layout is similar). Move the current video generation functionality (uploading photos/videos, selecting music, generating videos, and QR code download) to the Generator page. For now, focus on designing the Home page.
2. Modernize Home Page Structure: Design the Home page with a modern,animation layout consisting of three main sections: Title, Body, and Foot use context 7.

2.1 Title Section: Include a navigation bar with two links: "Home" (active by default) and "Generator" (linking to the Generator page). Use a sleek, responsive design with a bold header (e.g., "QWGenv - Quick Video Maker").
2.2 Body Section: Divide into three subsections(Introduce, Google Adsense ad and Comment scallable view):

2.2.1 Introduce Subsection: Include two categories:

2.2.1.1 First category titled "What is QWGenv?" with an introduction emphasizing the importance of generating videos quickly. Highlight key points like user-friendly interface, fast processing (e.g., within seconds), and accessibility for all skill levels.
2.2.1.2 Second category titled "Guide Steps with Photos" with a concise explanation and three steps (e.g., "Upload Media," "Select Music," "Generate Video") accompanied by small default step photos. Implement a hover effect where the photo zooms in when the user moves the mouse over it.

2.2.2 Google AdSense Ad Line: Reserve space for a responsive AdSense ad unit (e.g., 728x90 leaderboard or 300x250 rectangle) below the Introduce subsection.
2.2.3 Comment Area: Add a scrollable comment section where users can leave feedback. Include a simple form (e.g., text input and submit button) and display existing comments in a scrollable view.


2.3 Foot Section: Provide links to core pages: About Us, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service. Design these as clickable links that open modernized dialog boxes (modals) with relevant content when clicked (e.g., Contact Us modal shows a form or email address).


Note:
Introduce Content Details:

For "What is QWGenv?", write a 100-150 word introduction focusing on the quick video generation feature. Stress benefits like saving time, enabling creative expression, and supporting various devices (mobile/desktop).
For "Guide Steps with Photos," provide a brief description (e.g., 2-3 sentences) and three steps with placeholder photos. Ensure the default photo size is small (e.g., 100x100px) and zooms to a larger size (e.g., 300x300px) on mouse hover, with a smooth transition effect.

AdSense Placement: Leave additional space below the Introduce subsection (before the ad line) for future AdSense ad integration, ensuring flexibility for different ad sizes.
Comment Section: Design a scrollable comment area with a text input field and submit button. Allow users to view a list of comments (e.g., 5-10 visible at a time with a scrollbar) and store them temporarily (e.g., in local storage or a simple backend if available).
Foot Content with Modals: For each core page link (About Us, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service), implement a modern dialog box that appears when clicked. Each modal should contain placeholder content (e.g., 50-100 words) relevant to the page (e.g., Contact Us modal with a contact form or email link).
